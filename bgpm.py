    Compute the shortest AS path length for every origin AS from input BGP data files.

    Retrieves the shortest AS path length for every origin AS for every input file.

    Your code should return a dictionary where every key is a string representing an AS name and every value is a list
    of the shortest path lengths for that AS.

    Note: If a given AS is not present in an input file, the corresponding entry for that AS and file should be zero (0)
